LDAP, which stands for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, is an application protocol used over an IP network to manage and access the distributed directory information service. The directory service provides a systematic set of records, often in a hierarchical structure, like a telephone directory.

Here are some key points about LDAP:

1. **Directories**: An LDAP directory stores information on resources in a network and the users in an organization in a tree-like structure called a directory information tree (DIT). Each item in the directory is called an entry.

2. **Information Retrieval**: LDAP is used to search and retrieve information from the directory, such as finding an individual's email address or public key.

3. **Data Structure**: The data in an LDAP directory is structured in a hierarchy and can include entries for people, organizations, and groups. Each entry has a unique identifier called a Distinguished Name (DN).

4. **Security**: LDAP can also be used for authentication and access control, to determine what resources a user is allowed to access.

5. **Common Use Cases**: LDAP is often used in organizations to store user information and to authenticate users against the directory's data, like in Microsoft Active Directory, which is an implementation of LDAP.

LDAP provides a lightweight, efficient method for querying and modifying the directory information, which is essential for the administration and management of user and resource information within an organization.
