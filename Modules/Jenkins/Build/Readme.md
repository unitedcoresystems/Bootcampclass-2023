A "build" in Jenkins is defined by a set of instructions specified in the Jenkinsfile or the job configuration, and it can include additional steps such as code analysis, deployment, and more. The primary objective of a build in Jenkins is to automate the integration and delivery process, ensuring that the code is always in a deployable state.


1. **Compilation**: The source code is compiled to create executables.

2. **Testing**: The compiled code is tested using automated tests to ensure that it meets the specified requirements and doesn't contain any known bugs.

3. **Artifact Creation**: The compiled and tested code is then packaged into deployable artifacts, such as JAR or WAR files.

4. **Reports and Logs**: Jenkins generates various reports and logs during the build process, which helps developers identify and fix any issues.

5. **Status and Notifications**: After the build is complete, Jenkins provides a status (successful or failed) and can send notifications to the team.
