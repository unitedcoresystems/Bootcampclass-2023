# Permissions and Policies
Writing custom IAM policies allows you to define specific permissions for your AWS resources. You can grant or deny access to specific actions, resources, and conditions, providing fine-grained control over who can do what in your AWS environment.

### Steps to Write Custom IAM Policies:

1. **Sign in to the AWS Management Console**:
   - Use your administrator credentials to sign in.

2. **Open the IAM Console**:
   - In the AWS Management Console, click on "Services" and then select "IAM" under the "Security, Identity, & Compliance" category.

3. **Navigate to Policies**:
   - In the navigation pane, click on "Policies."

4. **Create a Policy**:
   - Click the "Create policy" button.

5. **Write the Policy**:
   - Go to the JSON tab.
   - Here, you can write your custom policy. Here's an example of a policy that allows listing all buckets and reading objects in a specific S3 bucket:
   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
         "Resource": "*"
       },
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Action": "s3:GetObject",
         "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
   - Replace `example-bucket` with the name of your S3 bucket.

6. **Review and Create Policy**:
   - Click "Next: Tags."
   - Add any optional tags.
   - Click "Next: Review."
   - Enter a name and description for the policy.
   - Click "Create policy."
