# Jenkins Interview Questions

**Interviewer:** What do mean by ‘Build’ in Jenkins?
**Answer:** 
In Jenkins, a "build" refers to the process of automatically compiling, testing, and creating deployable artifacts from the source code. A build is typically triggered by specific events, such as a commit to a version control system, or can be triggered manually or at scheduled times.

**Interviewer:** Can you explain what Continuous Integration (CI) is?
**Answer:** 
Thank you for your question ! Continuous Integration, or CI, is a development practice where team members integrate their work frequently, typically multiple times a day. Each integration is then automatically verified by an automated build and tests to detect integration errors as quickly as possible. The main goals of CI are to improve code quality, reduce integration conflicts, and streamline the release process.
`Example` "In my last project, we used Jenkins for CI, which significantly improved our development workflow by automating the build and test process. This helped us catch bugs early and release features more quickly."

**Interviewer:** How does CI work?
**Answer:** 
CI works by automatically pulling changes from a version-controlled code repository and starting a new build each time new code is committed. After the build is complete, automated tests are run to ensure the new changes didn't introduce any errors. Developers receive immediate feedback on the build and test results, and if any issues are found, they are expected to be fixed immediately. CI also often involves automated generation of documentation and other outputs.

**Interviewer:** How do people work day-to-day with CI?
**Answer:** 
On a day-to-day basis, developers are encouraged to commit changes to the repository frequently. They also need to write comprehensive automated tests to verify the functionality of the code. If a developer's changes break the build, it is their responsibility to fix it immediately. CI encourages collaboration and clear communication among team members, and it's important for any changes to the codebase or the CI process itself to be communicated clearly. Regular monitoring and improvement of the CI process are also necessary to maintain efficiency.

**Interviewer:** What are the Prerequisites for CI ? 
**Answer:** 
- A centralized code repository like GitHub where to manage code versions and handle multiple contributions from different team members.
- An automated build system, such as Jenkins, is needed to compile and build the code.
- A comprehensive automated tests and code quality analysis should be in place to verify the functionality and integrity of the code.
- Properly configured reuseable build scripts are necessary to automate the build and test processes.
- A stable and consistent development environment is crucial to ensure that the software behaves as expected.
- A Feedback notification system like slack/email to notify team members of the build and test results.

**Interviewer:** "Which tool do you use for CI? And how does it work?"
**Answer:**
"In our environment, we utilize a variety of open-source tools to streamline our development workflow:
1. **GitHub - Git Repository:** We store our source code and build instructions (pom.xml) in a Git repository. This repository is then integrated with Jenkins for seamless operation.
2. **Jenkins - Automation:** Jenkins is employed to automate various aspects of the build process, including compilation, testing, and packaging of applications. It automatically triggers a build based on predefined job configurations and interfaces with other tools to ensure an efficient process.
3. **SonarQube - Code Quality Analysis:** We use SonarQube to conduct thorough scans of our code, ensuring it meets our quality standards and passes through our quality gates.
4. **Nexus - Artifact Storage:** Upon a successful build, Jenkins stores the generated artifacts, such as JAR or WAR files, in Nexus for subsequent deployment.
5. **Slack/Emails - Feedback and Notification:** Jenkins provides timely feedback on the status of the build and test processes. If any issues arise, such as a failed build or test, our team is promptly notified through Slack or email, allowing us to address the problem swiftly."

**Interviewer:** What kind of plugins you have installed and used?
**Answer:**
"In my Jenkins environment, we have installed and utilized a variety of plugins such as: 
- **Maven** to Facilitates the seamless integration of Jenkins with Maven, automating the build and testing processes for Java applications.
