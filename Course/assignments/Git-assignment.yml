**Group Assignment: Collaborative Five-Course Meal Recipe using Git**

**Objective:** 
Familiarize with the basic git commands by collaboratively creating a recipe for a five-course meal. Each group member will represent a chef responsible for a particular course.

**Prerequisites:**
1. Basic understanding of Git.
2. Git installed on your machine.

**Instructions:**

1. **Repository Setup**:
    - One team member (the "Head Chef") will create a new repository on GitHub titled `FiveCourseMeal`.
    - Add all other members as collaborators to this repository.
    - Everyone should clone this repository to their local machines.

2. **Create Branches**:
    - Each chef (member) should create their own branch named after their course. For example: `appetizer`, `soup`, `main_course`, `dessert`, `drink`.

3. **Add Recipes**:
    - On your branch, create a new `.md` (Markdown) file named after your course. For example: `appetizer.md`.
    - Write down the recipe for your assigned course, including ingredients and step-by-step instructions.
    - Use markdown formatting to structure your recipe (e.g., `## Ingredients`, `### Steps`).
    - Commit your changes with a message, such as "Added appetizer recipe."

4. **Push to Repository**:
    - Push your branch to the remote repository.

5. **Reviewing & Merging**:
    - Once all members have pushed their branches to the remote repository, each member should review at least two other courses (not their own) by:
      - Checking out the branch of the course they're reviewing.
      - Leaving comments or suggestions (this can be done on GitHub using the "Pull Request" feature or directly in the code).
      - Approving the recipe if everything looks good.
    - The Head Chef will be responsible for merging all the branches into the `main` branch once reviews are done.

6. **Resolve Conflicts**:
    - If there are any merge conflicts, the team must work together to resolve them. 
    - Use this as an opportunity to practice resolving merge conflicts, a crucial skill when collaborating with Git.

7. **Compile the Five-Course Meal**:
    - Once all recipes are merged into the `main` branch, create a new file called `FiveCourseMeal.md`.
    - Compile all the recipes into this single file in the correct order: Appetizer, Soup, Main Course, Dessert, Drink.
    - Commit and push the compiled recipe to the `main` branch.

8. **Wrap Up**:
    - Reflect on the collaborative experience. Discuss what went well and what challenges arose during collaboration. 
    - Each member should pull the final version of the `main` branch to have the complete recipe on their local machine.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Correct usage of Git commands.
- Proper structuring and formatting of the Markdown files.
- Active participation of all members in creating, reviewing, and merging recipes.
- Successful resolution of any merge conflicts.
- Compilation of the complete Five-Course Meal recipe.

**Tips:**
- Regularly pull from the `main` branch to ensure your branch is up to date.
- Communicate with your team, especially during the review and merging processes.
- Practice good commit messages to keep track of changes made.

Good luck, chefs! Let's create a delightful five-course meal together.
