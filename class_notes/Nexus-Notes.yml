 We maintain a in Fault tolerant Architecture / Infrastructure:
Deploying a Highly available Architecture / Infrastructure:
  Upload Artifacts into:
    Nexus/
    JFrog 
    AWScodeArtifact jar/war/ear

Coding: 
  Git for versioning 
  GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket as a SCM tool 

Build: 
  maven create artifacts (deployable packages 
    that deployment(Tomcat/JBoss) servers can interprets )
  Runs JUnitTest cases written by developers 

Lifecycle:
    1.  clean Lifecycle 
       mvn clean  --- delete old artifacts
    2.  site/swagger Lifecycle
       site --- Create java classes

mvn deploy
  Artifacts = 2: 
    maven = jar, war or ear 
    nexus = jar, war or ear 

What can be done if the packages are deleted IN MAVEN?
What can be done if the packages can't be access because the build server is down?

Disaster management:
  We need to create backups for artifacts in artifactories

Coding:
  Local computers (Laptops) 
  What will happened if a developers laptop or env't breakdowns 
  developers commits changes in code in their local Repository 
  developers push their commits to the remote Repository in GitHub

Artifactory Repository:
  maven Repository   [jar/war/ear]
  yum Repository     [yum packages] 
  NodeJs Repository  [node packages] 
  apt Repository     [apt packages]

artifacts depends on the project and language:
  java   --> app.jar, maven-web-app.war, boa.ear 
  docker -->   Docker Image 
               docker build
               docker run 
  NodeJs  -- > NPM Packages
  yum --- > yum Packages  =  
            yum install maven git httpd tree
            yum is a package manager for Redhat and CentOS  
  
       yum install maven

  apt  -->  apt install tree 
            apt is a package manager for Ubuntu/Debian

  chocolatey --> choco install terraform 
             --> chocolatey is a package manager for windows OS  

  brew:     brew install terraform

IQ: How do you use Nexus in your environment?

Nexus: Is an Open source Artifactory Repository
       It is used to store and retrieve build artifacts
       We can retrieve artifacts when needed
       Nexus acts as a Disaster recovery server for maven    

JFrog: Is an  Artifactory Repository - Licence
       It is used to store and retrieve build artifacts 

Amazon CodeArtifacts:
     It is used to store and retrieve build artifacts 

We support Java based application dev't.

maven goals:
 mvn package  
    Creates artifacts in the target directory
 mvn install 
   Creates and store artifacts in maven-local-repo & target directory

 what is the difference between target and /target dir?? :
    target is a normal   
    /target is a root directory

    app is a normal          = mkdir app   
    /app is a root directory = mkdir /app 
    mkdir 

 what is the difference between mkdir dirName and sudo mkdir /dirName  
   mkdir app [this create app dir in your PWD] 
   mkdir /app [this create app dir in your the root dir]  

mvn deploy: uploads the build artifacts to maven remote repository (nexus)
    - validate
    - compile
    - test
    - create package in target directory
    - Packages created in mavenlocalrepo   
    - uploads THE PACKAGE to Nexus (Maven remote-repo)

IQ: How do your developers connect with your SCM repos in GitHub?
 via authentication: ssh or PAT 
  git push alaisName branchName  

IQ: How DOES MAVEN connect with SonarQube?
    MODIFY THE   <properties> <properties/> in pom.xml  
    by adding sonarqube server IPaddress and login credentials

Who decides on codeQuality:
===========================
Code Quality is generally a Team decision =   
Sprint planning meeting  
1. 25 rules --- Quality Profiles = javaAppQP    
2. Conditions -- Quality GATE = 
   code coverage => 90%


Is nexus built from a different env't  :
  We leverage aws cloud  servers = AZ  
  us-east-1  = NV [AZ1 , ... AZ6]  

  What’s the difference between code coverage and code quality
