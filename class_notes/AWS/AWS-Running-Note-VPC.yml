AWS VPC: Amazon's Virtual Private Cloud, Amazon VPC
=============
* what is a VPC?:
Basically, just think of a VPC as a virtual data center in the cloud.


1: VPC lets you provision a logically isolated section of the Amazon Web Services Cloud
    where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define.And you have 
    complete controlover your virtual networking environment,including selecting your own 
    IP address ranges,creation of subnets and configuration of route tables as well as 
    network gateways.

    *Analogy:* Think of a VPC as your own private space in a large office complex. 
    It's your rented area where you can set up your office, partition it, and 
    decide who can come in or out.

*You should be able to build out your own VPC from memory.

Example: For example, you can create a public-facing subnet for your web servers that has 
         access to the internet, and then you can place your backend systems such as your 
         databases, your application serversin a private-facing subnet with no internet access.

2: web servers are exposed to the internet but your sensitive application and database servers
    are not exposed to the internet.

3: We can leverage multiple layers of security, including security groups as well as network 
    access control lists to help you control access to Amazon EC2 instances in each subnet

4: VPC will allow us to create a Hardware Virtual Private Network or VPN connection between 
    your corporate data center and your VPC,and leverage the AWS cloud as an extension
    of your corporate data center.


Components of a VPC:
====================

Subnets:
      A subnet is a range of IP addresses in your VPC. Subnets can be used to separate 
      resources and manage access. Public subnets have routes to the Internet, while 
      private subnets do not, offering internal-only access.

*Analogy:* Within your office space (VPC), you can have different rooms (subnets) 
          for various departments like sales, development, and support. Some rooms 
          may be accessible to everyone (public subnets), while others may be 
          restricted (private subnets).

Route Tables:
        These are sets of rules (routes) that determine where network traffic 
        from your subnets or gateways is directed.

*Analogy:* Route tables are like the office directory that lists which rooms 
          (subnets) are on which floor and how to get to them.

Internet Gateways:
          This is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component 
          that allows communication between your VPC and the Internet.

*Analogy:* An Internet Gateway is like the main entrance to your office complex 
          that connects to the public streets. It allows people (data) to enter or leave 
          the complex (VPC).


Security Groups and Network ACLs:

      - *Security Groups:* Act as a virtual firewall for your instances to control 
         inbound and outbound traffic.
      - *Network ACLs:* Act as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of your subnets.

*Analogy:* Think of Security Groups as the security guards at the doors of your 
            office who check ID badges (access rules) before letting people in or 
            out of the rooms (instances). Network ACLs are like the building 
            security at the entrance of the complex, checking everyone at the subnet level.

NAT Gateways/Instances:
          Network Address Translation (NAT) devices enable instances in a private subnet 
          to connect to services outside your VPC without exposing those instances to the 
          public Internet.

*Analogy:* NAT gateways are like mailrooms in your office that handle mail (Internet 
          requestsfrom the private rooms without revealing the room number (IP addresses) 
          to the external world.


VPC Endpoints:
          VPC endpoints allow you to privately connect your VPC to AWS services and VPC 
          endpoint services powered by AWS PrivateLink without requiring an Internet 
          gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection.

*Analogy:* VPC Endpoints are like direct phone lines from your office to your business 
          partners. They allow you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS 
          services without using the public Internet.


VPN Connections and Virtual Private Gateway:
          VPN connections provide secure IPSec connections from your on-premise 
          network or data center to your AWS VPC. The Virtual Private Gateway is 
          the AWS side of a VPN connection that attaches to your VPC.

*Analogy:* These are like secure, encrypted tunnels from your office to your home 
            network, allowing you to access office resources while away from the office.

Peering Connections:
            A VPC peering connection allows you to connect one VPC with another via 
            a direct network route using private IP addresses. Instances in either 
            VPC can communicate with each other as if they are within the same network.

*Analogy:* Office peering is like an agreement between two companies in the same complex 
            to allow employees to visit each other's spaces without going outside. 


VPC Architecture:
====================
Typically you will have a three tier architechure:
 
 1) Web server : Public-facing subnet ie. they are internet accessible, and 
                 this can be done through port 80 or 443 (HTTP or HTTPS).

 2) Application server : private subnet. can only speak to the web tier and Databse tier.

 3) Database server : private subnet. can only speak to the application tier. work at the backend.

 So this is an example of a fully customizable network and the only front facing service is the web server


Demo the diagram:


CIDR s a notation for describing blocks of IP addresses and is used heavily in various 
networking configurations.

IP addresses contain 4 octets, each consisting of 8 bits giving values between 0 and 255. 
The decimal value that comes after the slash is the number of bits consisting of the routing  
a netmask, and also designates how many available addresses are in the block.

     1. IP address range. VPC- 10.0.0.0/16
     2. public subnet (10.0.1.0/24); Front End: instance, security group, Network ACL, 
                                                Route Table, Router, Internet Gateway or 
                                                virtual private Gateway.
     3. Private subnet (10.0.2.0/24); Back End: instance, security group, Network ACL, Route 
                                                Table, Router, internet Gateway or virtual 
                                                private Gateway.

VPC Features:
        What can we do with a VPC?
           1: launch instances into a subnet of your choosing.
           2: Assign custom IP address ranges in each subnet.
           3: Route Tables configure route tables between subnets.
           4: internet Gateway create internet gateway and attach it to our VPC
           5: More Control much better security control over your AWS resources.
           6: Access Control lists subnet network access control lists.
              you can use network access control lists (NACLs) to block specific IP addresses.

Comparing VPCs :
          Default VPC vs Custom VPC

          Default VPC : it is user friendly, All subnets have a route out to the internet, 
                        Each EC2 instance has both a public and private IP address.
          Custom VPC : fully co=ustomizable, takes time to set up


Benefits of Using a VPC:

      - *Security:* Your VPC’s default security settings can be adjusted to create a secure, 
        virtual network infrastructure tailored to your specific needs.
      
      - *Customization:* You can create a network that suits your business requirements, 
        such as specifying the IP address range and creating subnets.
      
      - *Isolation:* Being logically isolated from other virtual networks, VPCs provide a 
        high degree of privacy and security.
      
      - *Connectivity Options:* You can connect your VPC to the Internet, to your corporate 
        data center, or to other VPCs, depending on the needs of your application.



what can we do with the VPC?:
      - launch instances into a subnet of our choosing,
      - choose our own subnet address ranges.
      - assign custom IP address ranges in each subnet
      - configure route tables between our subnets.
      - create Internet Gateways and attach it to our VPC.
      - Better security controls over our AWS resources.
      - assign security groups to individual instances.
      - we can also have subnet network Access Control Lists
        or "ACLs" as well.



Default VPC / Custom VPC:

            we're going to create our own custom VPC. And you might be wondering what's the 
            difference is between a default VPC and a custom VPC. Well, the default VPC 
            is super user-friendly. It allows you to immediately deploy instances.
            
            You don't need to know anything about networking to be able to provision an EC2 
            instance in the AWS console. So, that's why Amazon gives us a default VPC,
            they're trying to make it easier for our developers to use AWS. And all subnets 
            in a default VPC have a route out to the internet.

            That means they're all internet accessible. And each EC2 instance has both a 
            public and private IP address.

So, those are the main differences.

        1: the default VPC is super user-friendly. It allows you to 
          immediately deploy instances.You don't need to know anything about networking
          to be able to provision an EC2 instance in the AWS console.

        So, that's why Amazon gives us a default VPC, they're trying to make it easier
        for our developers to use AWS.

        2: All subnets in a default VPC have a route out to the internet.
            That means they're all internet accessible.
        3: Each EC2 instance has both a public and private IP address.






Remember:    If you do delete a default VPC, you can recover it now.


VPC peering:
            This allows you to connect one VPC with another via a direct network route using private IP addresses





It's a collection of Internet Gateways, route tables, network ACLs, security groups, EC2 instances
and then of course, your public subnets and your private subnets.

Provisioning a VPC part 1.

-On the AWS console, scroll down to Network & content Delivery then to VPC. or you can search for it in the search bar.
-You can then go into Resources by Region. then to VPC's, you will then see all the regions available.
-if you go into US east1 N. Virginia, you will see default VPC in blue. it also create both Main route table and main network ACL by Default.
-You can then go ahead and click on Route tables to see our subnet associations.
-You can also go to the side bar and click on subnets, from there you each of the six subnets to see the availability zone under details.
- Go to create VPC in yellow. then click on VPC and more it will show you the subnet and all. when you click on the VPC only, you will have to manually create all your subnets and all.

Bastion host:
it's a special purpose computer on the network,
specifically designed and configured to withstand attacks and the computer
generally hosts a single application. For example, a proxy server,
and all other services are removed or limited to reduce the threat to this
computer. It is hardened in this manner,
primarily due to its location and purpose,
which is either on the outside of a firewall or inside a demilitarized zone and
what do they mean by demilitarized zone?
