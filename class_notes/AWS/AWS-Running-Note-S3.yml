*AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service)*

1. *Overview:*
   - A scalable storage service in AWS.
   - Used to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time from anywhere on the web.
   - Data is organized in buckets (containers) with a unique user-defined name within S3.

Well S3 basically stands for simple storage service.
So it's three S's, that's why it's called S3.
And it provides developers and IT teams
with secure, durable, highly scalable object storage.
And S3 is easy to use, the simple web services interfaces
to store and retrieve any amount of data
from anywhere on the web.


well, basically, S3 is a safe place to store your files.
And that's all it means by objects.
So when we say object storage,
we're talking about things flat files, basically.
So Word documents, pictures, movies, et cetera, et cetera.
So S3 is basically a safe place to store your files.
It's object based storage,
and the data is spread across multiple devices
and multiple facilities.

The basics of S3 are as follows:
    -  It's object based, 
    - It allows you to upload files.And your files can be anywhere from 
      zero bytesall the way up to five terabytes.
    - There is unlimited storage and files are stored
      in these things called buckets.


Bucket:
  Bucket is basically just a folder,in which to put your files that's all it is.


S3 is a universal namespace. So what does that actually mean?
Well, all that means is that the names must be unique globally.


File Uploads in to S3 Results:
    - when you upload a file to S3, you're going to receive an HTTP 200 code
      if the upload was successful, and that's going to come back to your browser.

    - S3 allows you to have multiple versions of your file


S3 is Object base:
    - key: And this is simply the name of the object.
    - value: And this is simply the data that is made up of a sequence of bytes
    - version ID: , and this is important for versioning.
    - metadata: If you've never heard the term metadata before, it just simply 
                means data about data. So it's data about the data that you're storing.
    - subresources:
                  - access control lists
                  - torrents

We are going to cover all the access control lists
and bucket policies coming up.


Data consistency model for S3:
    - read after write consistency for PUTS of new objects
    - eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES

S3- Guarantees:
    - Built for 99.99% availability,
    - Amazon guarantee 99.9% availability.
    - Amazon guarantees 99.99999999999


S3 Features:
    - Tiered storage Available ( Exam 5 points)
    - Lifecycle Management  (o you could say, "Hey, when this file is 30 days old,
        "move it to this tier, when it's 90 days old, "archive it off to Glacier.")
    - versioning
    - encrypt your objects at rest
    - multi factor authentication (MFA)
    - secure your data using access control lists and bucket policies

S3 Storage Classes:
    - S3 standard, this is the one with 99.99% availability and 11 nines of durability.
    - S3 infrequently accessed
    - S3 one zone infrequently access
    - S3 Intelligent Tiering (This is really cool technology. This is using machine learning.
          And basically what it does, is it looks at how often you use your objects,
          and then it will move your objects around the different storage classes based on what it's learned.
          So it will move it from S3 standard to S3 infrequently accessed because it knows
          that you don't access those files.)
    - Glacier
          1: S3 Glacier
          2: S3 Glacier Deep Archive  (7years)

    ===========================

S3 Charges- Bills $$:

    - more storage - increased bills
    - more request to objects ------> charges increase
    - storage management  

S3 Data Tranfer pricing:

    - cross region replication. (Well, let's say you've got a bucket and it's in US East one.
      And you want to automatically replicate your objects to another bucket that's in, let's 
      say, in Sydney, and you want to do that for high availability as well as, you know, 
      disaster recovery.
      So what will happen is as soon as you upload an object
      to your bucket in US East one,
      and you've got cross region replication turned on,
      those objects will automatically be replicated
      over to your bucket in Sydney.)


    - Transfer Acceleration (his enables fast, easy and secure transfers
      of files over long distances between your end users and an S3 bucket.
      And basically, it's taking advantage of Amazon's CloudFront's globally 
      distributed edge locations.)
      
        - Uses Amazon network as the backbone


S3 Region is global show it to the class

Demo: Create a bucket at objects to it and try to access it. Access Denide 

      - make it accessible
          - go to file --> action--> make public (error)
          - go to permissions--->edit----uncheck block all pub access--- save 
          - go to file --> action--> make public

          demo the next file to show errors


Restricting Bucket Access:
      - bucket policy and this is going to apply across the entire bucket.
      - object access is using object policies (applied to individual files within your bucket)
      - IAM policies to users and groups within your AWS account to control bucket access.

Creating a Static Website Using Amazon S3:

    - Use the Git repo
    - creat S3 Bucket viewable to the public
    - add dowloaded files from repo
    - select properties -----> static website hosting---Edit---->enable
    - index Document--- put (index.html)
    - error Document--- put (error.html)
    - Save changes

    - static web hosting has not endpoint
    - error ------- Permissions to read the content of the files

    - go to permission---Bucket policy--> edit--- copy the ARN---- Select policy generator
    - ---->select  S3 bucket policy----> principal (*)---Action(Get Objects)---- Paste the ARN copied( add /* to the ARN)
    - Add statement----> Generate policy--->copy the entire policy
    - paste in S3 bucket policy

    - Select properties---> static website hosting---Edit---->enable

       force the error page:



2. *Key Concepts:*
   - *Bucket:*
     - A container for storing data.
     - Globally unique name.
     - Defined in a specific region.
   - *Object:*
     - Fundamental entity stored in S3.
     - Consists of data, key (unique within a bucket), and metadata.
   - *Key:*
     - The unique identifier for an object within a bucket.
   
3. *Data Consistency:*
   - Offers strong read-after-write consistency automatically for all objects, without any additional cost.

4. *Storage Classes:*
   - *S3 Standard:*
     - For frequently accessed data.
   - *S3 Intelligent-Tiering:*
     - Automatically moves objects between two access tiers (frequent and infrequent) when access patterns change.
   - *S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access:*
     - For infrequently accessed data that can be recreated if lost, stored in a single availability zone.
   - *S3 Glacier:*
     - For long-term archival.
   - *S3 Glacier Deep Archive:*
     - For long-term archival with retrieval times in hours.
   
5. *Durability and Availability:*
   - 99.999999999% (11 9's) durability over a given year.
   - Availability depends on the storage class.

6. *Data Management:*
   - Lifecycle policies for automating transition between storage classes or expiration.
   - Versioning to keep all versions of an object.
   - Tagging for easy organization and management.

7. *Data Security:*
   - Data is encrypted at rest and in transit.
   - Supports user policies, bucket policies, and ACLs for access control.
   - MFA Delete and Versioning can be used for additional security.
   
8. *Access Control:*
   - *IAM:*
     - Use IAM users, groups, and roles to manage access to S3 resources.
   - *Bucket Policies:*
     - JSON-based policies to define permissions at the bucket level.
   - *ACLs:*
     - Grants read or write permissions to specific AWS accounts.

9. *Data Transfer Acceleration:*
   - Use Amazon CloudFront's globally distributed edge locations to accelerate uploads to S3.

10. *Pricing:*
    - Based on the storage class, amount of storage used, number of requests, data transfer out, and additional features used.

These are some of the key points to understand about Amazon S3. It is a powerful and versatile service with many features to support different storage needs.
