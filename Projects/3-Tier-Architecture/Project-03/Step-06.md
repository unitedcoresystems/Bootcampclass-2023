# Configure WordPress

Open http://<ip-address>/ in your browser. You will be asked for title of your new site, username, password, and address e-mail. Note that the username and password you choose here are for WordPress, and do not provide access to any other part of your server - choose a username and password that are different to your MySQL (database) credentials, that we configured for WordPress’ use, and different to your credentials for logging into your computer or server’s desktop or shell. You can choose if you want to make your site indexed by search engines.
