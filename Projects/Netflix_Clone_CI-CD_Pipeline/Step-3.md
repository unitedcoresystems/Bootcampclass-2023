# Step 3: How To create a TMDB (The Movie Database) API key, follow these steps:

1. **Create an Account or Log In**:
    - If you donâ€™t already have a TMDB account, go to [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and sign up.
    - If you already have an account, log in.

2. **Go to API Settings**:
    - Once logged in, click on your profile icon in the top right corner.
    - From the dropdown, select "Settings".
    - On the settings page, select the "API" tab from the sidebar.

3. **Request an API Key**:
    - Click on the "Request an API Key" button.
    - Select the appropriate option for your use case ("Developer" or "Commercial").
    - Fill in the required information for your application.
    - Read and agree to the API terms of service.
    - Click the "Submit" button.

4. **API Key Creation**:
    - Once your request has been approved, you will receive your API key.
    - The API key will also be available in your API settings page.

5. **Use the API Key**:
    - You can now use the API key to make requests to TMDB's API.

Make sure to keep your API key secret and not expose it publicly. If your API key is compromised, you should regenerate it immediately from your TMDB API settings page.
